# Usage

![pipguard demo](assets/demo.gif)

## Basic Usage

### Install a single package

```bash
pipguard install requests
```

pipguard will download, scan, and install the package from the scanned local cache.
By default, the report is summary-first: `CRITICAL` / `HIGH` / `MEDIUM` findings are
expanded, `LOW` findings are collapsed to package-level counts, and `CLEAN` packages are
shown only in the summary totals.

### Install from requirements.txt

```bash
pipguard install -r requirements.txt
```

Scans all packages in the file. Blocks on first CRITICAL or HIGH finding.

## CI Mode

In CI, you never want interactive prompts. Use `--yes` to suppress all confirmation prompts
and have pipguard exit 1 automatically on CRITICAL or HIGH findings:

```bash
pipguard install --yes -r requirements.txt
```

## Default Output

Successful installs keep raw `pip install` logs quiet unless you opt in with
`--show-pip-output`.

```text
$ pipguard install some-package
📦 Downloading to /tmp/pipguard-abcd1234 ...
🔍 Scanning 5 package(s) ...
Scan summary:
  Total packages: 5
  CRITICAL: 0  HIGH: 0  MEDIUM: 1  LOW: 2  CLEAN: 2

MEDIUM
  [MEDIUM] jsonschema
    [MEDIUM] jsonschema/validators.py:113
           Outbound network call (urllib.request.urlopen()) in runtime code

LOW
  [LOW] markupsafe — 1 finding
  [LOW] zipp — 1 finding
  Use --verbose to show LOW-level file details.

## Known CVE Lookup (osv.dev)

pipguard's AST scanner detects *suspicious behaviour*. The `--check-vulns` flag
adds a complementary signal by querying [osv.dev](https://osv.dev) for
*published* vulnerabilities in each package version:

```bash
pipguard install --check-vulns requests
```

Known CVEs appear in a dedicated **Known CVEs (osv.dev)** section — shown even
for packages the behavioural scan marks CLEAN:

```text
Known CVEs (osv.dev) — 1 CVE
  jinja2==3.1.5
    CVE-2024-56326 [MEDIUM] Jinja sandbox breakout through attr filter selection (fixed in 3.1.6)
```

CVEs are **informational by default** and do not block the install. To make them
a hard gate (exit 1), add `--fail-on-vuln` (which implies `--check-vulns`):

```bash
pipguard install --fail-on-vuln -r requirements.txt
```

!!! note "Opt-in network call"
    OSV lookups are the only outbound request pipguard makes during a scan, so
    they are opt-in. Without `--check-vulns` (or `[osv] enabled = true` in a
    policy file) pipguard stays offline. The lookup is best-effort — if osv.dev
    is unreachable it fails open and the behavioural scan still runs.

Policy-file equivalent:

```toml
[osv]
enabled = true       # same as --check-vulns
fail_on_vuln = false # set true for --fail-on-vuln
```

## Allowing Known-Legitimate Packages

Some packages legitimately access credential stores (e.g. `paramiko` reads `~/.ssh`).
Use `--allow` to reduce their finding from HIGH to MEDIUM:

```bash
pipguard install --allow paramiko paramiko
```

!!! warning "CRITICAL findings are never reduced"
    `--allow` only reduces HIGH → MEDIUM. CRITICAL findings always block, regardless of flags.

## Forcing a Package (Escape Hatch)

For known false-positives on fully-trusted internal packages:

```bash
pipguard install --force my-trusted-internal-pkg
```

!!! danger "Use with care"
    `--force` bypasses all checks and logs a warning. Never use in CI without code review.

## Allowing sdist Packages

By default pipguard exits with code 2 if a package falls back to sdist (source distribution),
because sdists execute build scripts. To opt in:

```bash
pipguard install --allow-sdist some-package
```

!!! danger "sdist installs execute arbitrary code"
    `--allow-sdist` bypasses a hard safety boundary. Even though pipguard runs AST scanning on
    `setup.py`, `pip install` will still **execute** setup.py and any build-backend code at
    install time. pipguard's AST scan does **NOT** prevent this.
    Never use `--allow-sdist` in automated pipelines without explicit review.

## All Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-r FILE` | Install from requirements file |
| `--yes` / `-y` | CI mode — no prompts, exit 1 on CRITICAL/HIGH |
| `--allow PKG` | Add package to per-invocation allowlist (HIGH→MEDIUM) |
| `--force PKG` | Bypass all checks for a specific package |
| `--allow-sdist` | Allow sdist fallback (DANGER: executes arbitrary code — AST scan does NOT prevent this) |
| `--require-hashes` | Require hash-locked requirements entries (`--hash=...` or URL hash fragment) |
| `--verbose` | Show full scan details, including LOW findings and CLEAN package list |
| `--show-pip-output` | Show raw pip install output instead of the quiet default |
| `--policy FILE` | Load policy file (default: `./pipguard.toml` if present) |
| `--intel-feed FILE_OR_URL` | Threat-intel JSON feed containing blocked package versions |
| `--enforce-intel` | Enforce intel feed denylist and block matching packages |
| `--check-vulns` | Query OSV.dev for known vulnerabilities (opt-in network call; informational) |
| `--fail-on-vuln` | Exit 1 if any package has a known OSV vulnerability (implies `--check-vulns`) |

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Clean — all packages installed |
| `1` | Blocked — CRITICAL or HIGH risk detected |
| `2` | Scan error — download failed or unsupported format |
